# Exercise 11

Make a program to read a full name character by character from the standard input.

The program shall filter, capitalize and then print it out to the standard output (terminal). 

The filtered name can only contain one space between parts of the name and uppercase/lowercase letters (a-z).

Donâ€™t use an array to store the name. The entered name shall be handled character by character.

 

Example:

Enter your full name: RoBe+rt   sMit0h
